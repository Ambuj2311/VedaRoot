VedaRoot - Medicinal Plant Detection using Vision Transformer and MERN


Step 1: Download the model from my google drive https://drive.google.com/file/d/19sx3tbj4yA_RR5p6by4OOm9LXR05XtAy/view?usp=sharing

Step 2: Put the model here (ensure the model.safetensors should be at right location) :- medicinal-plant-detection > backend > static > model > model.saftensors (Create folder named model then move the model in this folder)

Step 3: Open editor, move to the backend folder, install the requirements.txt in the backend using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Step 4: Run the app.py using the command "python app.py"

Step 5: Open another terminal, move to frontend/server and run command "npm install" it will installl node_module, then run the server.js file using the command "node server.js" or "npm start"

Step 6: Open another terminal, move to frontend/client and run command "npm install", then run the client using the command "npm start".

Now, you can enjoy detecting the different plants and leaves. For any help reach out to me on linkedIn or through email (asrimbuj@gmail.com)
